  ///
  ///       - The second segment is vertical, connecting the point

  ///         vertical segment (i.e., two consecutive breakpoints with equal
  ///         horizontal coordinates) indicates that the kernel function is
  ///         discontinuous which is permitted by the protocol. In this case,
  ///         we have a discontinuity at point 'qSpacing / 2' because:
  ///            
  ///           '0 == k(qSpacing / 2 - epsilon) != 
  ///                 k(qSpacing / 2 + epsilon) == 1 / 2 + epsilon / qSpacing'
  ///            
  ///         where 'epsilon > 0' is an arbitrarily small value approaching 0.
  ///
  ///       - The third segment connects the point '(qSpacing / 2, 1 / 2)' to
  ///         the point '(qSpacing, 1)'.
  ///
  ///     The combination of the three segments leads to the kernel function:
  ///
  ///                 /
  ///                |  0               if 0 < q < qSpacing / 2

  /// A wide variety of other functions can be constructed and provided as

  /// 'modifyKernel'. For each break-point a 64-bit horizontal coordinate 
  /// is given in 'X59' representation, and a 16-bit vertical coordinate
  /// corresponding to kernel's intensity is provided in 'X15' representation.
  /// Hence, each break-point takes 80 bits in the compact form. The
  /// break-points should be tightly packed within a 'uint256[]' array with
  /// their height appears first.
  ///
  /// @param curveArray The curve sequence contains historical prices in 'X59'
  /// representation. It should have at least two members. In other words,
  /// every member of the curve sequence represents a historical price
  /// 'pHistorical' which is stored in the form:
  ///
  ///   '(2 ** 59) * (16 + qHistorical)'
  ///
  /// where
  ///
  ///   'qHistorical := log(pHistorical / pOffset)'.
  ///
  /// Hence, each member of the curve occupies exactly '64' bits as explained
  /// in 'Curve.sol'. And each slot of 'curveArray' comprises four members of
  /// the curve sequence.
  ///
  /// The first and the second members of the curve sequence correspond to the
  /// boundaries of the current active liquidity interval (i.e., 'qLower' and
  /// 'qUpper') with the order depending on the desired history. The last
  /// member of the curve represents the current price of the pool, i.e.,
  /// 'qCurrent'.
  ///    
  /// For every integer '0 <= i < l', denote the (i + 1)-th historical price
  /// recorded by the curve sequence as 'p[i]'. Additionally, to simplify the
  /// notations, the out-of-range price 'p[l]' is assigned the same value as
  /// 'p[l - 1]'. Now, for every integer '0 <= i <= l', define also 
  ///    
  ///   'q[i] := log(p[i] / pOffset)'.
  ///
  /// The curve sequence is constructed in such a way that for every
  /// '2 <= i < l', we have:
  ///
  ///   'min(q[i - 1], q[i - 2]) < q[i] < max(q[i - 1], q[i - 2])'.
  ///
  /// This ordering rule is verified upon initialization of any pool and it is
  /// preserved by every amendment to the curve sequence.
  ///
  /// One candidate for the initial curve sequence is
  ///
  ///   'q[0] := log(p[0] / pOffset)',
  ///   'q[1] := log(p[1] / pOffset)',
  ///   'q[2] := log(p[2] / pOffset)'.
  ///
  /// where
  ///
  ///   - 'p[2]' is the market log price at the time of initialization.
  ///
  ///   - '|q[1] - q[0]| = qSpacing' which is selected based on tokens'
  ///     economic characteristics such as price volatility.
  ///
  ///   - 'q[0] < q[2] < q[1]' if the historical price has reached 'q[2]' from
  ///     above.
  ///
  ///   - 'q[1] < q[2] < q[0]' if the historical price has reached 'q[2]' from
  ///     below.
  ///
  /// More intuitively, members of the curve can be viewed as historical peaks
  /// of the price with later members representing more recent peaks. The
  /// initial curve is supplied by the pool creator and it determines
